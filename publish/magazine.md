# This $100 Million Private Island For Sale In The Bahamas Is Sure To Lure Billionaires

Private islands have long attracted the ultra-rich, especially in the Bahamas.
And one of the latest private islands sure to turn the heads of billionaires 
is Little Pipe Cay in The Exumas.

Listing agents Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes of Eklund | Gomes at Douglas Elliman are marketing the property alongside Edward de Mallet Morgan of Knight Frank. Eklund says that the increase in price by $15 million is due to rising demand in nearby U.S. markets, as well as the effect of cryptocurrency.

“This price reflects the incredible surge we are seeing in luxury home values especially in places nearby the Bahamas like Miami and Palm Beach,” Eklund tells Forbes. “I have never seen a more powerful real estate market and the Bahamas, being a popular tax haven for crypto, justified this price that much more.”
